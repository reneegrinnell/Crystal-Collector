# About
Crystal Collector is a simple, dynamic math game built using jQuery.

## Game Play
At the start of the game, a random number ("Target Value") will appear and
each of the four crystal buttons below will be assigned different random
values. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click it.
            
Win a round by matching your total score to the randomly selected target 
value. If the total score exceeds the target value, you lose.
